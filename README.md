Nimble - Supercharge your productivity
======

## Introduction

In short, Nimble is productivity on steroids. It is an innovative context-aware tool that provides the convenience of common actions to complement the web surfing experience. For each webpage, there are a list of common things that the user can do and we allow users to do them really easily.

For example while browsing Hacker News, I might want to share the link to the top news. Firstly, I launch the Nimble bar and select the top news URL. Next, I will be able to share the URL via Facebook, Twilio, etc.

While browsing Flickr, if you see photos that you fancy, you may use the Nimble bar to select a photo and save it to Dropbox.

Nimble is built upon an extensible plugin system such that new workflows and actions can be added in easily. This encourages involvement from the developer community as they can contribute new workflows and code to make Nimble even better.

## Installation

1. `npm install -g bower` to install Bower globally.
